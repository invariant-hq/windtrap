- see if we can get a dune-promote workflow with expect tests using executables. it's very annoying to have libraries as they are included in the release.
- testable function to create testables. consider dropping the labels, probably not useful.
- align output of expect tests to ppx_expect further.
- inline tests are broken, they exit successfully when there's failing tests. might not be generating .corrected files correctly.
